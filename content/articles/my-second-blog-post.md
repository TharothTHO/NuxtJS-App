The flu, measles and other infectious diseases can be contagious. They can spread through social groups as people transmit germs to one another. Some people have wondered if the mental illness known as depression also spreads through social networks. It doesn’t, a new study finds.

Edward Hill was part of a research team that investigated how, if at all, teens’ moods and attitudes affect the mental health of others. “Having depressed friends does not make you more likely to become depressed yourself,” he now concludes. Hill is a graduate student at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England. There he studies complexity science, which deals with systems affected by many factors.

Depression is a disease. People who suffer from this mental illness feel ongoing sadness and apathy. Often they lack energy and have difficulty concentrating. Many have trouble working, sleeping or interacting with others. Depressed teens can be grouchy and have a prickly personality. They also face an elevated risk of suicide. Indeed, as of 2010, depression was the second leading cause of death for Americans aged 10 to 24, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So, it’s nothing to be ignored.

While the new study showed depression was not contagious, it found good mental health can be catching. “Our study suggests that having mentally healthy friends can help someone recover from depression or even remain mentally healthy in the first place,” says Hill.
