title: Future cars may offer personal sound zones — no earphones needed.
description: Today, you wear earphones if you want to listen to music in a car without disturbing others. Someday soon, the car’s headrest may broadcast those tunes so that you can hear them but others in the car won’t have to.

Road trips can seem extra-long when someone else’s annoying music fills the car. What if you could listen to only your music without headphones and no one else would hear it? Although that may sound futuristic, the technology is closer than you might think. Researchers in France are working to deliver such personal sound zones that adapt as conditions in your car change.

Why bother? Headphones are good at controlling what you hear, but they can be uncomfortable, too. And if you crank the volume of your music up too high to drown out other noise, you risk damage to your hearing.

That’s something Jan Mayes knows a lot about. She’s a retired audiologist, a type of health care professional who specializes in hearing. Mayes is based in Vancouver, British Columbia in Canada. “Using headphones or earbuds can cause hearing loss,” she notes. And not just in the elderly. At the volume many kids listen to music, she says, “nearly 50 percent of young people aged 12 to 35 [are] at risk.”

Personal listening bubbles, or zones, inside of a car could let you hear well without having to drown out other sounds with high volumes. They also would bring many new possibilities. Everyone in a car could listen to their own audio privately. GPS alerts could go only to the driver. Passengers could make phone calls without being overheard
